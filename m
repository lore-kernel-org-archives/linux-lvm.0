I really have no clue, fortunately dmraid is usually used for boot
disks, so it should be started before udev has a chance of messing with
devices. btw, md already does this, and redhat's initrd does this as
well.
The real solution to this is so simple.
Just ditch the partition detection code from the kernel, and move it to
userspace where it belongs.
For the time being use BLKPG_DEL_PARTITION, to undo what the kernel
should not have done.

i'd rather not see it coupled with udev :P
maybe i am limited, but i really fail to see how an event driven model
could be at all useful in this cases, and i am really convinced that the
effort needed to make i work is too high compared to possible benefits.
The biggest question being: How do you know you have scanned all
possible PV for a given volume group, and you have to activate it.
Anyway i still think my proposal is sensible and adapts to the current
paradigm of lvm2.
