There's something not quite right there:
  Why doesn't the 'lvdisplay' issue a message about the duplicate PV?
  - run 'vgscan -vvvv' to see what lvm2 is really doing with all the
    relevant devices

  What lvm2 version? 
   - could be old and not containing the code to do the detection
     correctly?

  Are there non-upstream-default config settings that had the effect of turning
off the detection?  
   - see 'lvm dumpconfig' output or /etc/lvm/lvm.conf plus any compile-time
     default changes


Standard procedure these days is to ask people to run 'lvmdump -a'
(scripts/lvm_dump.sh in the source tree) to capture the relevant information
for examination.

But I don't yet see why it didn't also open the other devices, write a warning
message about duplicate IDs, and do the right thing and give them
precedence.
