Because otherwise DM would default to having dzd to "unsupported",
meaning the feature would never be turned on regardless of the bottom
device capabilities.

The old approach used the -1 value to indicate "has not been set". That
was only really intended as a value for the stacking drivers, not for
the LLDs. It was a bit of a hack and I'd rather deal with dzd the same
way as we do with clustering.

My first approach was to set it in dm-table.c before stacking. But I
thought it was icky to have the stacking driver ask for defaults and
then have to tweak them for things to work correctly.

The other option is to have blk_set_default_stacking_limits(). Or we
could add a flag to blk_set_default_limits to indicate whether this is a
LLD or a stacking driver.

We already special-case BLK_SAFE_MAX_SECTORS when setting the request
function. And that's the only non-stacking user of the default limits
call. So that's why I disabled dzd there. Since this is a stable bugfix
I also wanted to keep it small and simple. But I'm totally open to
suggestions.
