Just out of curiosity I looked at my systems and I don't see any such IO, even for mounted FS.

You can try running following commands to log writes and where are they comming from (show the result via dmesg)

echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump; sleep 10; echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump;

By doing so I noticed dm-thin writing to my otherwise unused dm thin pool every second. After looking at the code in dm-thin.c, it looks like the kernel is periodically
commiting metadata every second even if there was no IO to the pool in the time period. I think process_deferred_bios function should probably check if anything changed
before commiting metadata unconditionally when 1s timer is up. Looks like dm-cache-target.c is doing it right.
