Right, means TRIM doesn't zero the TRIM'd blocks.

But otherwise it looks like you're in good shape relative to TRIM.

Unfortunately, the failed discard to the snapshot-origin device disables
ext4's discards for the entire volume (even after you remove the
snapshot).

But the following patch fixes that:

Subject: dm snapshot: add discard support to the snapshot-origin target

Allow the snapshot-origin target to pass discards to the origin device
(after any copyout of the region being discarded; but generally speaking
that copyout won't be needed as the region will have already been copied
to the cow).

So for example, when you remove a file from an ext4 mounted origin
volume it triggers copyout to the snapshot.  When the DISCARD is then
issued during the subsequent journal commit no copyout is needed.
