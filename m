You need to size your snapshot proportional to the rate of change you
expect during the life of the snapshot.  This change can happen to
either the origin device or directly to the snapshot device.  Regardless
of which one; if you expect excessive change you want to size the
snapshot larger, or vice-versa if you expect little change.

As for monitoring, LVM2 provides dmeventd-based snapshot usage
monitoring that is enabled by default as of LVM2 2.02.53.

When you're low on space you'll see messages like the following in
/var/log/messages:

Sep 16 21:15:05 really-raw dmeventd[12522]: dmeventd ready for processing.
Sep 16 21:15:11 really-raw lvm[12522]: Monitoring snapshot test-testlv_snap
Sep 16 21:15:15 really-raw lvm[12522]: Snapshot test-testlv_snap is now 92% full.
