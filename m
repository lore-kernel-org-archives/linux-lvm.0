I was able to boot this system by taking an initramfs from another Fedora 1=
5 test system and putting it in /boot and referencing it in grub.conf.  How=
ever, I need to find out why an initramfs I build on the system is unable t=
o boot.

When I'm in dracut, I was able to do some checking.  Using the lvm commands=
, I was able to activate and deactivate the vg, display the lvs, but not us=
e them.  I would get "device not found", and in /dev/mapper, the lvm device=
s were not there.  There were other lvm devices there, but not from my prim=
ary system lvm.  The only thing that stands out about it is that it is ext4=
, not ext3.

Comparing the decompiled initrds, there's no modules that stand out.  Sas.o=
ut is a listing of the WORKING initrd, tfs.out is the NOT WORKING initrd.

[root@testfs ramdisks]# diff sas.out tfs.out

1491d1490
< ./usr/lib64/libnss_files.so
1517a1517
> ./usr/share/plymouth/themes/default.plymouth

Nothing there looks relevant.  Libcryptsetup needs updating on the test sys=
tem I pulled the initrd from.  The q-logic firmware is irrelevant.  There a=
re a couple of older kernels on the test system.  Libcap.so is a dependency=
 of legato backup software.  Libnss_files should have nothing to do with ac=
cessing an LVM.

So I'm stuck.  My system is up, but only if I build an initrd on another sy=
stem and copy it over, meaning next time I update the kernel it will not bo=
ot.  Nothing's jumping out at me as obviously missing modules from the brok=
en initrd.  Where else can I look?
