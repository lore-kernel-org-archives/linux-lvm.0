How many programs actually depend on BLKFLSBUF dropping the pages used
in /dev/ram?  The fact that it did this at all was a historical
accident of how the original /dev/ram was implemented (in the buffer
cache directly), and not anything that was intended.  I think that's
something that we should be able to fix, since the number of programs
that knowly operate on the ramdisk is quite small.  Just a few system
programs used by distributions in their early boot scripts....

So I would argue for dropping the "special" behavior of BLKFLSBUF for
/dev/ram.
