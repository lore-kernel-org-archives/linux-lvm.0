Hello,

I'm using LVM2 on my system and I faced an issue that I've set myself to 
resolve. The essence of the issue is shown in the following /sbin/lilo -t 
command output: 

> root@sega:/home/users/ilj# /sbin/lilo -t
> Warning: '/proc/partitions' does not match '/dev' directory structure.
>     Name change: '/dev/dm-0' -> '/dev/lvm/home'
> Warning: Name change: '/dev/dm-1' -> '/dev/lvm/tmp'
> Warning: Name change: '/dev/dm-2' -> '/dev/lvm/usr'
> Warning: Name change: '/dev/dm-3' -> '/dev/lvm/var'
> Added linux-2.6.23 *
> Added 2.6.22
> Added linux-2.6.19.5
> The boot sector and the map file have *NOT* been altered.
> 4 warnings were issued.

I'm pretty novice to device-mapper (hey, i'm a mere user! :) ) and LVM. I use 
basic configurations for both. Nothing really special.

These warnings LILO returns weren't always there. They appeared after a recent 
system update (I'm running Source Mage). There were no such warnings 
previously. I contacted a LILO maintainer on a related issue and he kindly 
responded with confirmation that these warnings are not LILO related. As far 
as I know, LVM is a set of userspace tools and the actual job is done by 
device-mapper. I did try to contact the developers of dev-mappper project but 
no single person replied to my message so I'm writing you now, the developers 
of LVM.

My goal is to comprehend the origin of the warnings and their actual meaning, 
also set things straight so that LILO doesn't return these warnings.

Hopefully, you are the guys that can help me with this :)

Information about what software version numbers I use and configuration 
details:

- linux 2.6.23
(not patched but not vanilla either; configured tuned and tweaked with my own 
two hands :))

device-mapper related linux configuration options:

> CONFIG_BLK_DEV_DM=y
> # CONFIG_DM_DEBUG is not set
> CONFIG_DM_CRYPT=y
> CONFIG_DM_SNAPSHOT=y

> # CONFIG_DM_MULTIPATH_RDAC is not set
> # CONFIG_DM_DELAY is not set
> # CONFIG_DM9102 is not set

This is it. If I missed anything, please, let me know.
I'm really looking forward to getting answers to my questions. I'm more than 
just curious now since I've spent quite a period of time already trying to 
figure out the answers on my own, bothered random people in real life and on 
the Internet in forums, IRC and now in mailing-lists :)

I really want to know what these warnings are all about :)
