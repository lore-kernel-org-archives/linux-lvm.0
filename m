Hi,

[cross posted to linux-lvm, because I think it is a lvm problem]

I see similar errors on an IB-NAS6210 box. Apparently, lvm2 tries to
mlock/munlock all readable maps it finds in "proc/self/maps", i.e
also the "[vectors]" page.  Between 3.0 and 3.4 there has been the
change f9d4861f "ARM: 7294/1: vectors: use gate_vma for vectors user
mapping", which might have changed the behaviour when mlocking
vectors.

In LVM2, there is a list in lib/mm/memlock.c of maps to ignore:

/* list of maps, that are unconditionaly ignored */
static const char * const _ignore_maps[] = {
    "[vdso]",
    "[vsyscall]",
};

"[vdso]" seem to be based on gate_vma as well. Thus, I think
"[vectors]" needs to be added to this list.
