What if we never read DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG from the
database. Instead how about, if DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG is set
by "dmsetup udevflags", we save it as something like DM_IGNORE_DEVICE.
Otherwise, if it's a spurious event, we read DM_IGNORE_DEVICE from the
database. After "dm_flags_done", if DM_IGNORE_DEVICE is set, we set
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG. This leaves the other rules free to
mess with DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG all they want.
