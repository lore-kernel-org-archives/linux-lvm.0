I do not think that it is bad idea. It is supposed to work and we do not
want to "optimize" for broken devices (or broken cheap crap, as someone
concisely described before).

I think that we do not need to revert it, we just need to do the "right
thing" in the underlying layers. That said:

1. We need to honor all the "discard limits" so the discard bios does
not actually fail.
2. If the device is composed of various other devices, we should return
-EOPNOTSUPP is none of the devices support discard.
3. We should succeed, if at least one of the devices support discard and
it does not fail for any reason.
4. We should not advertise discard_zeroes_data if any of the devices
does not zero data or does not support discard.

I am not sure how "hard" is to assure those conditions in DM. If those
conditions are met, we can rely on consistent information in the layers
above.

Thanks!
