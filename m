I still think we need to stick with the simple rule: "EOPNOTSUPP returned for a particular bio means that it is not supported for that particular bio" - I don't know what else we can do, without creating an ambiguity...

This does, however, suck for the layer calling in to a complex device.

What is the overhead for sending discard bios down to a device that does not support it?
