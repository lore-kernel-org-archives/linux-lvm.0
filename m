My first guess is that LVM is shifting the content of hte device such that 
it no longer aligns well with the RBD striping (by default, 4MB).  The 
non-aligned reads/writes would need to touch two objects instead of 
one, and dd is generally doing these synchronously (i.e., lots of 
waiting).

I'm not sure what options LVM provides for aligning things to the 
underlying storage...
