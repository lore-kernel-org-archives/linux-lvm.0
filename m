The blkdev_issue_discard() interface is synchronous.  Given that, yes it
will cause jbd2 to block waiting for it to complete.

For DM, the discard would not actually be issued to the physical storage
there is still work that would be done to submit the bio only to have DM
return -EOPNOTSUPP.

But ext4 doesn't care if it is on DM or not; so I agree that cost of
continuing to issue discards would be higher on non-DM storage.

That said, the user asked for discards via -o discard.  Ext4 is taking
that to mean "no the user only _really_ asked for discards if they will
always work".

If ext4 is committed to that disable-on-first-failure hueristic then
Documentation/filesystems/ext4.txt should probably speak to it.

Meaning you assemble a tailormade DM linear (concat) device that mixes
the two?  What are you using to assemble that device -- presummably some
code that is aware of ext4's metadata and data layout?  Code hooked off
of mkfs?

That is what DM does.  DM will only return -EOPNOTSUPP if a particular
target doesn't support discards.  If only one device supports discards
then the entire logical DM device advertises discard support.
