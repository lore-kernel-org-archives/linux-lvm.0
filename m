Aren't discard operations considered barriers?  If there are needless discard operations being sent to the disk then it seems like this would have a non-zero performance penalty, just by virtue of blocking IO submissions at the block device layer.

If my understanding of the mechanics is flawed, then please ignore.

Hybrid storage is potentially an increasingly popular configuration.  We've been looking at DM-mapped SSD RAID-1 + HDD RAID-6 arrays for ext4 to allow storing only the metadata on SSD.  That said, it may make sense to have the DM translation layer check the component devices of an LV to see if discard is supported on any of them, and only return -EOPNOTSUPP if none of them do.

While not a perfect solution for the case where an LV is migrated onto a device that does support discard, I don't think we have to handle every corner case perfectly to still handle reasonable use cases in a sensible manner.

Cheers, Andreas
