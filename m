There is quite a lot of init/ code, to handle parsing the concise DM
format, that is being proposed for inclusion.  I question why that
DM-specific code would be located in init/

There also needs to be a careful comparison done between the proposed
init/ code to support consise DM format and the userspace lvm2
equivalent (e.g. lvm2.git commit 827be0175)

That aside, the DM targets that are allowed to be supported by this dm=
commandline boot interface must be constrained (there are serious risks
in allowing activation of certain DM targets without first using
userspace tools to check the validity of associated metadata, as is done
by the DM thin and cache targets).  Also, all targets supported must be
upstream.  "linear", "verity" and "bootcache" DM targets are referenced
in Documentation, "bootcache" must be a Google target.  I'm not aware of
it.
