	Had I read the lists first, I would have known this would cause
grief. I've tried a number of things that I've subsequently read on the
list, but I fear that I'm just making things worse.

Background:
	I had a nice MythTV installation on Gentoo 1.4; Original
partitions were 
		Mount		Drive
/dev/hda1	boot		120Gb non-lvm
/dev/hda2	swap
/dev/hda3	/
/dev/hdd1	/video 	120Gb non-lvm

I wanted to convert to lvm, so I put in /dev/hdb (an 80Gb) with the
following partitions

/dev/hdb1	boot
/dev/hdb2	swap
/dev/hdb3	root	(containing /etc /lib /mnt /proc /sbin /dev
/root)
/dev/hdb4	extended
/dev/hdb5	lvm	(containing /usr /home /opt /var /tmp /video

	I copied each partition from hda to the corresponding partition
on hdb using cp -a.

	The intention was to move the 80Gb drive to hda (with hda5 as
lvm), use the two 120Gb drives as hdb and hdd (both as lvm) and have one
VG named VGforMyth. 
	What happened was I was able to boot from the new root on the
80GB, but was unable to load the VG. As a result, I had a minimally
functional shell, but no access to the vg or lv mentioned above. Oh, and
the original root system from the 120Gb was now repartitioned as lvm, so
there was no going back.

	In the intervening days, I have tried several suggested
solutions, including vfcfgrestore, but so far no success. It's getting
difficult to recall all of the details (some late nights). As I said
earlier, I fear that I am just making things worse for myself. At this
moment, I am using the gentoo cdrom install disk as a rescue disk. The
80Gb is back at hdb, the 120Gb are at hda and hdd. The hda1 now has the
same VG name as hdb5, but hda1 is reported as active whereas hdb5 shows
as inactive. (/dev/hdc is the dvd)

	Is there any way that the partition be accessed, or should I
just write this off and call it a lesson? There are some files on the
lv's that I cannot re-create if they are lost. They're not that big a
deal, but I would rather not lose them.

	I'm not sure what info would be needed to figure this out, so
I'll include below the output from some of the lvm commands. Please let
me know if there is other info needed.

Thanks

	Bob
