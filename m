Hi all,

Sorry the delay of my reply.

Sorry about the missing context, I should've added the change log and
worked a bit more in the cover letter with a more verbose explanation on
the reasons for this patch.

Exactly, this is the "concise" format from dmsetup, it also makes it
easier for users to copy and paste from "dmsetup --concise", which
doesn't mean this format is ideal, but imho keeping it consistent with
dmsetup is a good thing, please let me know if you have any other ideas.

The main reason was that, taking "md=" and "raid=" as a reference, its
command line arguments are parsed in init/do_mounts_md.c, I could move
the parsing logic to drivers/md/* but I was wondering if it wouldn't be
better to be consistent with init/do_mounts_md.c, what do you think?

Yes, I am taking a deeper look into the lvm2 parsing code, and actually
we can use almost the same logic for parsing, which seems better because
lvm2 is already using it, we already have some validation/review and it
also seems cleaner.
I'll update this in the next version.

I see, I can add this constraint and I'll clean up the documentation for
the next version.


Thank you all for your comments and reviews, I am working on the next
version of this patch series taking yours comments into consideration
and cleaning up several parts of the code and documentation.

Please let me know if you have any other concerns.

Thanks
Helen
