Nope. That makes a lot of sense.

multipathd already refuses to reload newly created devices before it
sees the creation uevents to try to avoid this.  I assume that the
problem you are seeing is on the coldplug after the pivot root, where
the devices already exist, or am I confused here.  I wonder if we can do
something similar where we would ideally delay all device reloads until
after the coldplug.  The problem is figuring out when it's finished.
