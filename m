Does it use device mapper (or it just "plays well with the device 
mapper")? Or is it a totally different technology?

I didn't find it explained very clearly in Zumastor HOWTO on 
http://zumastor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/zumastor-howto.html (other 
than pointers to /dev/mapper/zumatest, which probably means it uses 
device mapper).
