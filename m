Hi

As not a direct dm developer - isn't this going a bit too far ? -
This way you will need to soon move halve of the userspace functionality into 
kernel space.

IMHO would be way more progressive to start using initramdisk and let 
userspace resolve all the issue.

Clearly once you start to wait for some 'devices' to appear - then you will 
need to way for CORRECT device as well - since sda,sdb... goes in random 
order, so you would need to parse disk headers and so on.

What you are effectively doing at this moment is you are shifting/ballooning 
'ramdisk' code into kernel image - just to be named a kernel.

So why it is so big deal to start to use ramdisk on ChromeOS?
That would have solved most of problems you have or you will have instantly.

Zdenek
