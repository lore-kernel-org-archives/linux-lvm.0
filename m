The patch was implemented with late initcall partially to be contained
in drivers/md/*, but to support rootwait, adding a hook from
prepare_namespace seems the way to go indeed.

hmm, I didn't test this yet but at least from what I can see in the
code, verity_ctr() calls dm_get_device() that ends up calling
name_to_dev_t() which should take care of PARTNROFF, this requires a bit
more investigation.

Ack, I'll update this.
