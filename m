Actually i am not worried too much about vgscan/pvscan, i am much more
worried for mount, swapon, one particular piece of crap called
hibernate-cleanup.sh etc.
besides, i am positive that users get confused having both /dev/sda1 and
/dev/mapper/via_aggehhahyue1

udev is not the only thing on earth that wants to activate a volume
group. what if i wanted to do it manually?

whoever wrote about editing the conf file?
i wrote about detecting that a device is already in user by
device-mapper and skipping that.
