And by activating a vg manually i don't benefit from the filter? why?

What about if it is a ha-cluster suite that needs to activate the volume
group. I can't have udev activate that on sight, it will probably
corrupt data.

probably because this is the only available way now.
anyway this method tends to suck when you have a complex setup.
and lvm device filters are not very intuitive to setup.

Let's make a deal, you code that in udev, and in the meantime try to
convince Linus in ditching partition detection code from kernel.
I will code the filter for current lvm.

doing this will require changing how lvm tools work.
1) disable the automatic vgscan performed by every lvm command
2) modify pvscan to be able to scan a single device
