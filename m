Right, underneath within DM/DM-subystem, we should be able to keep and
restore those reasons for why it has been flagged with
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG till now and when the state is good
enough that we can drop it, we would do it transparently for higher
(non-dm and non-dm-subsystem) layers. So if there's a case that is not
currently handled by 10-dm.rules or 11-dm-<subsystem>.rules, we can fix
that there. If it's a generic rule that applies to all DM, not just
subystem, then yes, we can move that to 10-dm.rules (will have a look at
your patch [1]).

Aha! Well, honestly, I don't remember the exact details and context of
that fix, but I know we haven't found a better way...

The c) case - well, it's questionable what should be done in that case,
because that means we have literally cut off the underlying device while
it was still in use. Any further IO from higher layers will return IO
errors, will queue IOs or, in the worse case, issue IOs to a device that
we don't want to anymore.

Anyway, if I understand correctly, we simply need to signal higher
layers either:

  A) device is unusable, forget it and clear all your current extra
records you have about this device (including removing any custom
symlinks for udev). That would also map to SYSTEMD_READY=0.

  B) device is unusable temporarily, restore any records you need, wait
for the DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG=1 to drop to 0 (or being unset).

What do you think about keeping a single
DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG for this, just having a different
value, say "2" to denote the B case? Otherwise, we need 2 distinct
variables (which is harder for others to accept I bet).

I didn't consider that there might be extra records to keep around for
anything else than blkid (13-dm-disk.rules) and DM/DM subsys (10-dm and
11-dm-subsystem.rules). But you're probably right here - differentiating
the A) and B) from above could be beneficial for some layers above. If
nothing else, then at least the systemd's SYSTEMD_READY case in
99-systemd.rules.

If we could still keep the single DM_UDEV_DISABLE_OTHER_RULES_FLAG for
others to check, I'd really like to have only that one, not adding more.
