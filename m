Just a quick follow-up.  We had a discussion on snapshot-origin discard
support and arrived at this needing to be done in 2 steps:
1) have snapshot-origin ignore discard but return success
2) process the discard, discard treated as a write to the origin, if
   user passes an option to enable it

The concern is that the patch I proposed can break existing scripts that
create filesystems on pristine origin devices (that have a snapshot(s)).
Instead of only copying out the various minimalist changes that mkfs
does (when discard isn't used) the entire origin device would be copied
out (when the entire device is discarded early in mkfs.ext4).

I'll circle back to working on this in a few weeks (the annoying bit is
the userspace change to make the snapshot-origin's discard behavior
configurable via lvcreate -s --enable-origin-discards ...; maybe someone
else will get to it before I do :)
