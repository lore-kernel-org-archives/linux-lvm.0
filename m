Hi Alasdair,

I like the last idea the best. Dm is the only one who has the
overall information about the storage, hence it should provide
some of that information for others to do the right thing.

Christoph mentioned that ext4 is the only one actually disabling
discard on -EOPNOTSUPP, but firstly that's not true (gfs2 and
nilfs does that as well) and secondly it is the right thing to
do! What else  should we be doing when it tells us that "discard is
not supported"? continue trying ? that does not make sense at all!

However when we have dm device where part of the device supports
discard due to underlying hardware capability we just can not return
EOPNOTSUPP from blkdev_issue_discard, because it is just not true! It
does support discard, but it is not consistent through the whole device
and at some layer we should notice that and not let it through. How to
do this is just implementation detail. We can either do it at dm level,
while handling bios, or we can export "do not return eopnotsupp"
information and blkdev_issue_discard() should use that information to do
the right thing.

Thanks!
