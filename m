It should be noted that discards are treated as writes.  This means that
a snapshot should not be taken of an origin volume before a filesystem
is placed on that origin.  Doing so may result in the entire origin
volume being discarded (mkfs.ext4 does this) which would cause copyout
of the entire origin volume to the snapshot.
