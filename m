Indeed I have had a few bad experiences with Ubuntu's udev rules, but 
never like this...
I don't think a wrong udev rule can hangup the whole machine with such 
symptoms, you really think so?

- lvs and/or "lvchange --refresh ..." processes hanging forever in 
kernel code (and AFAIR it was in DM region, that's the /proc/pid/stack 
trace which I unfortunately lost)

- "sync" also cannot complete, so I can only do force reboot without flush
