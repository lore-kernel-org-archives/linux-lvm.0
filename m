I haven't repeated any runs for each combination, e.g. 1 test with 16kb
lvm stripe width and 2kb BLCKSZ, 1 test with 16kb lvm stripe width and
4kb BLCKSZ...

I did reformat each partition between tests. :)  When I have tested for
repeatability in the past I have found results to fluxuate up to 5%, so
I would claim the 1.5% to be noise.
